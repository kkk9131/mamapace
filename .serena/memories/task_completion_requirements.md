# Task Completion Requirements

## Code Quality Checks
1. **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` and fix all issues
2. **Formatting**: Run `npm run format` to ensure consistent formatting
3. **Type Checking**: Ensure TypeScript compiles without errors
4. **Testing**: Run `npm test` and ensure all tests pass

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests should pass with reasonable coverage
- Integration tests when applicable
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Security and performance tests when relevant

## Code Standards
- Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
- Implement proper error handling
- Use appropriate accessibility labels
- Follow React Native performance best practices
- Integrate with existing theme system

## Documentation
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update TypeScript interfaces when needed
- Ensure proper JSDoc comments for public APIs

## Git Workflow
- Create feature branches from main/master
- Write clear commit messages
- Test thoroughly before committing
- Consider PR reviews for major changes

## Deployment Considerations
- Test on both iOS and Android if possible
- Ensure compatibility with different screen sizes
- Verify performance on lower-end devices
- Check accessibility compliance
